# College Majors Students Earnings - Data Visualization Project
## Description
We'll use a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college beteween 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survery](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conduct surveys and aggregates the data. 

The dataset used in this project can be find on this [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) made by FiveThirtyEight, who cleaned the original dataset.

Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.

The goal of this project is to use some visualization techniques to answer questions like:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?

We'll use a different type of plots for each of these questions. We'll primarily work with the *pandas* library, that has many methods for quickly generating common plots from data in DataFrames.
